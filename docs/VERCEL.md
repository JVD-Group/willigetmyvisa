# Deploying to Vercel (no-code path)

These steps use Vercel’s GitHub integration so you can deploy and test the PoC
from the browser without writing code or installing tools.

## Before you start
- A GitHub account with access to `JVD-Group/willigetmyvisa`.
- A free Vercel account (sign up at https://vercel.com/signup).

## One-time setup
1. **Import the repo**: In Vercel, click **Add New… → Project → Import Git Repository**, choose `JVD-Group/willigetmyvisa`, and keep the default root directory.
2. **Environment variable**: In the **Environment Variables** section, add `DATABASE_URL` pointing to a persistent Postgres instance (e.g., Vercel Postgres or your own Neon/Supabase URL). Example: `postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DBNAME`.
   - If you skip this, Vercel would fall back to SQLite on ephemeral storage and your data would be lost on each redeploy.
3. **Deploy**: Click **Deploy**. Vercel will build the Serverless Function at `api/index.py` and serve the FastAPI app.

## How to open the PoC in your browser
1. After the deploy finishes, open the project’s **Domains** page and click the autogenerated URL (e.g., `https://your-project.vercel.app`).
2. Append `/api/v1/docs` to that URL to open the interactive API docs. Example: `https://your-project.vercel.app/api/v1/docs`.
3. Use the **Try it out** buttons to call endpoints (Health check, Create user, Create visa application, etc.).

## Redeploying changes
- When code changes are merged to `main`, Vercel will auto-deploy a new version. You can also click **Redeploy** in the Vercel dashboard if needed.

## Troubleshooting
- **403/404 at /api/v1/docs**: Ensure the deployment finished and you are using the project URL plus `/api/v1/docs`.
- **Database errors**: Double-check the `DATABASE_URL` value and that the Postgres instance is reachable from Vercel.
- **Cold start delays**: The backend runs as a Serverless Function. First request may take a couple of seconds; subsequent requests are fast.

## Non-developer quick checklist (clicks only)
1. Sign in to Vercel in your browser.
2. Click **Add New… → Project → Import Git Repository** and pick `JVD-Group/willigetmyvisa` from GitHub.
3. In the setup screen, scroll to **Environment Variables** and add `DATABASE_URL` with your Postgres connection string.
4. Click **Deploy** and wait for the green checkmark.
5. Open the project’s **Domains** tab and click the generated URL.
6. In the browser address bar, append `/api/v1/docs` to that URL to open the API docs.
7. Use **Try it out** in the docs to test endpoints—no coding required.

## What I can and cannot do
- I cannot log into your GitHub or Vercel accounts or click deploy on your behalf (no credential access from here).
- I can supply exact steps and help debug any Vercel build/runtime errors you encounter.
